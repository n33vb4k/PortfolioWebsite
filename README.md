# My Portfolio Site

Welcome to the repository for my first proper web development project! ðŸš€

---

## Project Overview

This portfolio site serves as a personal space to:

- Highlight and share my coding projects so far.
- Document my progress as I grow and learn in web development.
- Experiment with modern web development tools and workflows.

The site will evolve over time as I update it with new features, improvements, and projects.

## Tech Stack

The portfolio is built using a modern web development workflow, incorporating:

- **Frontend**: 
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Superset of JavaScript that adds static types for enhanced reliability.
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast and modern build tool for frontend projects.

- **Potential Backend** (Future Plans):
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - A lightweight Python web framework for running interactive projects, if required.

## Current Status

- The project is in its initial stages and will be worked on from time to time.
- Focus areas include designing a clean and responsive UI, and integrating dynamic content as my coding portfolio grows.
